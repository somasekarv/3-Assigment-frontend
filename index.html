            <p class="cont1">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia.
                 Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
                A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
                Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
                 which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.
                Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2]
                 up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

            <p class="div1">Mutton</p>
            <p class="cont1">Lamb, hogget, and mutton, generically sheep meat,[1] are the meat of domestic sheep, Ovis aries. 
                A sheep in its first year is a lamb and its meat is also lamb. The meat from sheep in their second year is hogget. Older sheep meat is mutton.
                Generally, "hogget" and "sheep meat" are not used by consumers outside Norway, New Zealand, South Africa, Scotland, and Australia. 
                Hogget has become more common in England, particularly in the North (Lancashire and Yorkshire) often in association with rare breed and organic farming.
                In South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, "mutton" often means goat meat.
                At various times and places, "mutton" or "goat mutton" has occasionally been used to mean goat meat.[2]
                Lamb is the most expensive of the three types and in recent decades sheep meat is increasingly only retailed as "lamb", sometimes stretching the accepted distinctions given above.
                The stronger-tasting mutton is now hard to find in many areas, despite the efforts of the Mutton Renaissance Campaign in the UK. 
                In Australia, the term prime lamb is often used to refer to lambs raised for meat.
                Other languages, such as French, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic, make similar or even more detailed distinctions among sheep meats by age and sometimes by sex and diet—for example,

            <p class="cont1">
                In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.
                Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.
                Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers.
                Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed.
                Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.
                The word beef is from the Latin word bōs,[1] in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).[2] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served.
                thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles.
